    """
    Returns a summarized version of the given text using a variation of
    the TextRank algorithm.
    The input must be longer than INPUT_MIN_LENGTH sentences for the
    summary to make sense and must be given as a string.

    The output summary will consist of the most representative sentences
    and will also be returned as a string, divided by newlines. If the
    split parameter is set to True, a list of sentences will be
    returned.

    The length of the output can be specified using the ratio and
    word_count parameters:
        ratio should be a number between 0 and 1 that determines the
    percentage of the number of sentences of the original text to be
    chosen for the summary (defaults at 0.2).
        word_count determines how many words will the output contain.
    If both parameters are provided, the ratio will be ignored.
